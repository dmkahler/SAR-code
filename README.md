# SAR and InSAR Analysis Repository  
*Useful code for SAR, InSAR analysis*  

## Overview

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are remote sensing techniques used to analyze Earth's surface deformation, topography, and other geophysical phenomena. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and scripts to facilitate SAR and InSAR data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Overview

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) are advanced remote sensing techniques widely used in geoscience and environmental monitoring. SAR systems onboard satellites transmit microwave signals towards the Earth's surface and record the backscattered signals, allowing for the generation of high-resolution images regardless of weather conditions or time of day.

### Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

SAR is a remote sensing technology that uses radar to create images of the Earth's surface. Unlike optical sensors, SAR operates in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, enabling it to penetrate clouds and foliage. SAR systems can collect data in various polarizations and wavelengths, allowing for the extraction of valuable information about surface roughness, vegetation cover, soil moisture, and more.

### Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)

Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is an advanced SAR technique that measures surface deformation with high precision. InSAR works by comparing the phase of radar signals acquired at different times or from different viewing angles. By measuring changes in the phase of these signals, InSAR can detect subsidence, uplift, and other ground deformation phenomena with millimeter-level accuracy. InSAR has numerous applications, including monitoring volcanic activity, tracking land subsidence, and studying earthquake deformation.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and scripts to facilitate SAR and InSAR data processing, analysis, and visualization. By leveraging NASA's Vertex and MintPy software packages, among others, users can efficiently process SAR and InSAR data, extract valuable geophysical information, and generate insightful visualizations.
